#  Music Playlist Manager

This is a Java console application that manages a music playlist using **Singly Linked List** and **Doubly Linked List** data structures. The project was created as part of the Data Structures course assignment (CENG 202).

##  Project Overview

The playlist manager supports basic and advanced operations on songs, including:

-  Add Song  
-  Remove Song  
-  Display Playlist  
-  Move Song (drag-drop simulation)  
-  Play Next / Previous Song  

> All operations are handled dynamically using linked list structures — singly for basic operations and doubly for enhanced navigation.


## 📁Project Structure

- `Playlist.java` – Contains both SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList implementations  
- `PlaylistManager.java` – Console menu UI for testing and interacting with the playlist   
- `README.md` – You are reading it!
